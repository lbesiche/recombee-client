# Recombee Client

an **unofficial** Recombee Dart & Flutter Client

## Usage

This  package is still in a very early stage, needs heavy refactoring.

```dart
void main() async {
  final client = RecombeeClient(
    databaseId: 'your database  id',
    publicToken: 'your public token',
    useHttps: true,
  );

  
  final request1 = AddDetailView(userId: 10, itemId: 1);

  await client.send(request1);

  final request2 = AddCartAddition(userId: 10, itemId: 1);

  await client.send(request2);
}
```
